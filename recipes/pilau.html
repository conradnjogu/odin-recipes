   <h1>Pilau rice</h1> 
   <img src="../images/pilau.jpg" alt="pilau rice">
   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Pilau rice is the perfect accompaniment to a curry feast. The Hairy Bikers add whole cardamom, cloves, bay and cinnamon for a heady fragrance, along with a nice bit of butter and chicken stock for a rich taste. Serve with any of your favourite curries.</p>

   <p>The dish is sometimes called a pilaf, pilaw, pullao, or pilav, depending on the country in which it’s being cooked. The word (or maybe we should say ‘words’) refers to the cooking technique, rather than the dish itself.</p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>½ tsp coriander seeds</li>
     <li>6 cardamom pods</li>
     <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
     <li>8 cloves</li>
     <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
     <li>2 bay leaves</li>
     <li>75g/2½oz butter</li>
     <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
     <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
     <li>½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
     <li>½ tsp black mustard seeds</li>
     <li>300g/10½oz basmati rice, rinsed and drained</li>
     <li>500ml/18fl oz chicken or vegetable stock, fresh or made from 1 stock cube
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>Using a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander seeds into a coarse powder. Add the cardamom pods and grind until the husks split and the seeds are lightly crushed. Add the cumin, cloves, cinnamon and bay and pound very lightly for a few seconds, to mix.</li>
     <li>Melt half the butter in a sauté pan or wide-based saucepan over a medium heat. Fry the onion and garlic for 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly. Sprinkle in the turmeric and mustard seeds, plus all the ingredients from the pestle and mortar. Fry gently for 2 minutes, stirring.</li>
     <li>Mix in the rice to coat it in the buttery spices. Add the stock and a good pinch of black pepper. Add a pinch of salt if needed (stock from a cube will already contain salt).</li>
     <li>Stir well and bring to the boil. Give a final stir then cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce the heat to its lowest setting and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
     <li>When the rice is cooked, cut the rest of the butter into small pieces. Remove the pan lid and dot the butter over the hot rice. Leave to melt for a few seconds, then quickly fluff up the rice using a fork, taking care not to break up the grains.</li>
     <li>Replace the lid and leave to stand for 5 minutes before serving. (Warn your guests not to eat the cardamom, cinnamon or any whole cloves.)</li>
   </ol>
