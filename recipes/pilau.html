   <h1>Pilau rice</h1>

   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>Pilau rice is the perfect accompaniment to a curry feast. The Hairy Bikers add whole cardamom, cloves, bay and cinnamon for a heady fragrance, along with a nice bit of butter and chicken stock for a rich taste. Serve with any of your favourite curries.</p>

   <p>The dish is sometimes called a pilaf, pilaw, pullao, or pilav, depending on the country in which it’s being cooked. The word (or maybe we should say ‘words’) refers to the cooking technique, rather than the dish itself.</p>
